    abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a significant role in the field of network security, dealing with the ever-increasing number of network threats. Machine learning-based IDSs have attracted a lot of interest owing to their powerful data-driven learning capabilities. However, it is challenging to train the supervised learning algorithms when there are no attack data at hand. Semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms, which train the model with only normal data, are more suitable. In this study, we propose a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection-based IDS that leverages the capabilities of representation learning and two anomaly detectors. In detail, the autoencoder (AE) is applied to extract representative features of normal data in the first step, and then two semi-supervised detectors, the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), are trained on the derived features. The two detectors collaborate to detect anomalous samples. The OCSVM predicts the abnormal samples initially, and after that, the GMM is applied to recheck the misclassified samples further. The experiments demonstrate that the AE improves the detection rate, and two detectors are more promising than a single one.},

    abstract = {With the rapid growth of social media networks and internet accessibility, most businesses are becoming vulnerable to a wide range of threats and attacks. Thus, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are considered one of the most essential components for securing organizational networks. They are the first line of defense against online threats and are responsible for quickly identifying potential network intrusions. Mainly, IDSs analyze the network traffic to detect any malicious activities in the network. Today, networks are expanding tremendously as the demand for network services is expanding. This expansion leads to diverse data types and complexities in the network, which may limit the applicability of the developed algorithms. Moreover, viruses and malicious attacks are changing in their quantity and quality. Therefore, recently, several security researchers have developed IDSs using several innovative techniques, including artificial intelligence methods. This work aims to propose a support vector machine (SVM)-based deep learning system that will classify the data extracted from servers to determine the intrusion incidents on social media. To implement deep learning-based IDSs for multiclass classification, the CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 dataset has been used for system evaluation. The CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 dataset was subjected to several preprocessing techniques to prepare it for the training phase. The proposed model has been implemented in 100,000 instances of a sample dataset. This study demonstrated that the accuracy, true-positive recall, precision, specificity, false-positive recall, and F-score of the proposed model were 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 0%, and 100%, respectively.},

    abstract = {Computer network is playing a significantly important role in our society, including commerce, communication, consumption and entertainment. Therefore, network security has become increasingly important. Intrusion detection systems have received considerable attention, which not only can detect known attacks or intrusions, but also can detect unknown attacks. Among the various methods applied to intrusion detection, logistic regression is the most widely used, which can achieve good performances and have good interpretability at the same time. However, intrusion detection systems usually confront with data of large scale and high dimension. How to reduce the dimension and improve the data quality is significant to improve the detection performances. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an effective intrusion detection model based on pls-logistic regression with feature augmentation. More specifically, the feature augmentation technique is implemented on the original features with goal of obtaining high-qualified training data; and then, pls-logistic regression is applied on the newly transformed data to perform dimension reduction and detection model building. The NSL-KDD dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the empirical results show that our proposed method can achieve good performances in terms of accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate.},

The development of effective and efficient intelligent network intrusion detection methods using advanced machine learning algorithms is of great importance for defending against various network intrusions in complex network environments. In this study, a network intrusion detection method based on decision tree twin support vector machine and hierarchical clustering, named HC-DTTWSVM, is proposed, which can effectively detect different categories of network intrusion. First, the hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to construct the decision tree for network traffic data, where the bottom-up merging approach is used to maximize the separation of the upper nodes of the decision tree, which reduces the error accumulation in the construction of the decision tree. Then, twin support vector machines are embedded in the constructed decision tree to implement the network intrusion detection model, which can effectively detect the network intrusion category in a top-down manner. The detection performance of the proposed HC-DTTWSVM method is evaluated on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that HC-DTTWSVM can effectively detect different categories of network intrusion and achieves comparable detection performance compared to some of the recently proposed network intrusion detection methods.},

    abstract = {Intrusion detection in computer networks is of great importance because of its effects on the different communication and security domains. The detection of network intrusion is a challenge. Moreover, network intrusion detection remains a challenging task as a massive amount of data is required to train the state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect network intrusion threats. Many approaches have already been proposed recently on network intrusion detection. However, they face critical challenges owing to the continuous increase in new threats that current systems do not understand. This paper compares multiple techniques to develop a network intrusion detection system. Optimum features are selected from the dataset based on the correlation between the features. Furthermore, we propose an AdaBoost-based approach for network intrusion detection based on these selected features and present its detailed functionality and performance. Unlike most previous studies, which employ the KDD99 dataset, we used a recent and comprehensive UNSW-NB 15 dataset for network anomaly detection. This dataset is a collection of network packets exchanged between hosts. It comprises 49 attributes, including nine types of threats such as DoS, Fuzzers, Exploit, Worm, shellcode, reconnaissance, generic, and analysis Backdoor. In this study, we employ SVM and MLP for comparison. Finally, we propose AdaBoost based on the decision tree classifier to classify normal activity and possible threats. We monitored the network traffic and classified it into either threats or non-threats. The experimental findings showed that our proposed method effectively detects different forms of network intrusions on computer networks and achieves an accuracy of 99.3% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The proposed system will be helpful in network security applications and research domains.},

    abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which play a critical role in monitoring, managing, and controlling industrial processes, face flexibility, scalability, and management difficulties arising from traditional network structures. Software-defined networking (SDN) offers a new opportunity to overcome the challenges traditional SCADA networks face, based on the concept of separating the control and data plane. Although integrating the SDN architecture into SCADA systems offers many advantages, it cannot address security concerns against cyber-attacks such as a distributed denial of service (DDoS). The fact that SDN has centralized management and programmability features causes attackers to carry out attacks that specifically target the SDN controller and data plane. If DDoS attacks against the SDN-based SCADA network are not detected and precautions are not taken, they can cause chaos and have terrible consequences. By detecting a possible DDoS attack at an early stage, security measures that can reduce the impact of the attack can be taken immediately, and the likelihood of being a direct victim of the attack decreases. This study proposes a multi-stage learning model using a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and decision tree-based classification to detect DDoS attacks in SDN-based SCADA systems effectively. A new dataset containing various attack scenarios on a specific experimental network topology was created to be used in the training and testing phases of this model. According to the experimental results of this study, the proposed model achieved a 97.8% accuracy rate in DDoS-attack detection. The proposed multi-stage learning model shows that high-performance results can be achieved in detecting DDoS attacks against SDN-based SCADA systems.},

    abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of machine learning models in the cyber-security applications (e.g., an intrusion detection system (IDS)), most of these models are perceived as a black-box. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important to interpret the machine learning models to enhance trust management by allowing human experts to understand the underlying data evidence and causal reasoning. According to IDS, the critical role of trust management is to understand the impact of the malicious data to detect any intrusion in the system. The previous studies focused more on the accuracy of the various classification algorithms for trust in IDS. They do not often provide insights into their behavior and reasoning provided by the sophisticated algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we have addressed XAI concept to enhance trust management by exploring the decision tree model in the area of IDS. We use simple decision tree algorithms that can be easily read and even resemble a human approach to decision-making by splitting the choice into many small subchoices for IDS. We experimented with this approach by extracting rules in a widely used KDD benchmark dataset. We also compared the accuracy of the decision tree approach with the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

    abstract = {The rapid uptake of digital services and Internet of Things (IoT) technology gives rise to unprecedented numbers and diversification of cyber attacks, with which commonly-used rule-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are struggling to cope. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being exploited as second line of defense, since this methodology helps in extracting non-obvious patterns from network traffic and subsequently in detecting more confidently new types of threats. Cybersecurity is however an arms race and intelligent solutions face renewed challenges as attacks evolve while network traffic volumes surge. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Clustering-based Intrusion Detection (Acid), a novel approach to malicious traffic classification and a valid candidate for deployment at the network edge. Acid addresses the critical challenge of sensitivity to subtle changes in traffic features, which routinely leads to misclassification. We circumvent this problem by relying on low-dimensional embeddings learned with a lightweight neural model comprising multiple kernel networks that we introduce, which optimally separates samples of different classes. We empirically evaluate our approach with both synthetic and three intrusion detection datasets spanning 20 years, and demonstrate Acid consistently attains 100% accuracy and F1-score, and 0% false alarm rate, thereby significantly outperforming state-of-the-art clustering methods and NIDSs.},

    abstract = {Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (SIDS) play a crucial role within the arsenal of security components of most organizations. They can find traces of known attacks in the network traffic or host events for which patterns or signatures have been pre-established. SIDS include standard packages of detection rulesets, but only those rules suited to the operational environment should be activated for optimal performance. However, some organizations might skip this tuning process and instead activate default off-the-shelf rulesets without understanding its implications and trade-offs. In this work, we help gain insight into the consequences of using predefined rulesets in the performance of SIDS. We experimentally explore the performance of three SIDS in the context of web attacks. In particular, we gauge the detection rate obtained with predefined subsets of rules for Snort, ModSecurity and Nemesida using seven attack datasets. We also determine the precision and rate of alert generated by each detector in a real-life case using a large trace from a public webserver. Results show that the maximum detection rate achieved by the SIDS under test is insufficient to protect systems effectively and is lower than expected for known attacks. Our results also indicate that the choice of predefined settings activated on each detector strongly influences its detection capability and false alarm rate. Snort and ModSecurity scored either a very poor detection rate (activating the less-sensitive predefined ruleset) or a very poor precision (activating the full ruleset). We also found that using various SIDS for a cooperative decision can improve the precision or the detection rate, but not both. Consequently, it is necessary to reflect upon the role of these open-source SIDS with default configurations as core elements for protection in the context of web attacks. Finally, we provide an efficient method for systematically determining which rules deactivate from a ruleset to significantly reduce the false alarm rate for a target operational environment. We tested our approach using Snort’s ruleset in our real-life trace, increasing the precision from 0.015 to 1 in less than 16 h of work.},

In order to improve the intelligence and accuracy of network intrusion detection and reduce false alarms, a new deep neural network (NDNN) model based intrusion detection method is designed. A NDNN with four hidden layers is modelled to capture and classify the intrusion features of the KDD99 and NSL-KDD training data. Experiments on KDD99 and NSL-KDD dataset shows that the NDNN-based method improves the performance of the intrusion detection system (IDS) and the accuracy rate can be obtained as high as 99.9%, which is higher when compared with other dozens of intrusion detection methods.

    abstract = {Cybersecurity protects and recovers computer systems and networks from cyber attacks. The importance of cybersecurity is growing commensurately with people's increasing reliance on technology. An anomaly detection-based network intrusion detection system is essential to any security framework within a computer network. In this article, we propose two models based on deep learning to address the binary and multiclass classification of network attacks. We use a convolutional neural network architecture for our models. In addition, a hybrid two-step preprocessing approach is proposed to generate meaningful features. The proposed approach combines dimensionality reduction and feature engineering using deep feature synthesis. The performance of our models is evaluated using two benchmark data sets, namely the network security laboratory-knowledge discovery in databases data set and the University of New South Wales Network Based 2015 data set. The performance is compared with similar deep learning approaches in the literature, as well as state-of-the-art classification models. Experimental results show that our models achieve good performance in terms of accuracy and recall, outperforming similar models in the literature.},

We identify five core design principles to consider when designing a deep learning-empowered intrusion detection system (IDS). We proposed the Temporal Convolution Neural Network (TCNN), an intelligent model for IoT-IDS that aggregates convolution neural network (CNN) and generic convolution, based on these concepts. To handle unbalanced datasets, TCNN is accumulated with synthetic minority oversampling technique with nominal continuity. It is also used in conjunction with effective feature engineering techniques like attribute transformation and reduction. The presented model is compared to two traditional machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR), as well as LSTM and CNN deep learning techniques, using the Bot-IoT data repository. The outcomes of the experiments depicts that TCNN maintains a strong balance of efficacy and performance. It is better as compared to other deep learning IDSs, with a multi-class traffic detection accuracy of 99.9986 percent and a training period that is very close to CNN.},

    abstract = {Recently, Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures in deep learning have achieved significant results in the field of computer vision. To transform this performance toward the task of intrusion detection (ID) in cyber security, this paper models network traffic as time-series, particularly transmission control protocol / internet protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predefined time range with supervised learning methods such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), CNN, CNN-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN), CNN-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) and CNN-gated recurrent unit (GRU), using millions of known good and bad network connections. To measure the efficacy of these approaches we evaluate on the most important synthetic ID data set such as KDDCup 99. To select the optimal network architecture, comprehensive analysis of various MLP, CNN, CNN-RNN, CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU with its topologies, network parameters and network structures is used. The models in each experiment are run up to 1000 epochs with learning rate in the range [0.01-05]. CNN and its variant architectures have significantly performed well in comparison to the classical machine learning classifiers. This is mainly due to the reason that CNN have capability to extract high level feature representations that represents the abstract form of low level feature sets of network traffic connections.},

It has been extremely difficult to strike the balance between accuracy and prediction time. This paper aims at using a LSTM based Machine Learning model to detect anomalies in the network traffic and redirecting all malicious requests to a honeypot based black hole server. This algorithm was trained and tested on the CICIDS2017 data set consisting of numerous attacks such as Patator based attacks, Web based Brute Force, DoS sloworis, DoS slowhttptest, DoS Hulk, DoS GoldenEye, DDoS LOIT and some other categorical attacks. The results exhibit a high degree of accuracy in detection of these attacks, and the model is suitable for use in existing distributed servers.},

The proposed method utilizes positional embedding technique to associate sequential information between features, then a variant stacked encoder-decoder neural network is used to learn low-dimensional feature representations from high-dimensional raw data. Furthermore, we apply self-attention mechanism to facilitate network traffic type classifications. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed RTIDS on two publicly available real traffic intrusion detection datasets named CICIDS2017 and CIC-DDoS2019 with F1-Score of 99.17% and 98.48% respectively. A comparative study with classical machine learning algorithm support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning algorithms that include recurrent neural network (RNN), fuzzy neural network (FNN), and long short-term memory network (LSTM) is conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

    abstract = {Network intrusion has become a leading threat to breaching the security of Internet applications. With the reemergence of artificial intelligence, deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used for network intrusion detection. However, one main problem with the DNN models is the dependency on sufficient high-quality labeled data to train the model to achieve decent accuracy. DNN models may incur many false predictions on the imbalanced intrusion datasets, especially on the minority classes. While we continue advocating for using machine learning and deep learning for network intrusion detection, we aim at addressing the drawback of existing DNN models by effectively integrating decision tree and feature tokenizer (FT)-transformer. First, the decision tree algorithm is used for the binary classification of regular (normal) traffic and malicious traffic. Second, FT-transformer performs the multi-category classification on that malicious traffic to identify the type of attacking traffic. We conduct the performance evaluation using three publicly available datasets: CIC-IDS 2017, UNSW-NB15, and Kitsune datasets. Experimental results show that among three datasets, the proposed technique achieves the best performance on the CIC-IDS 2017 dataset with the macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 84.6%, 83.6%, and 93.2%, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection method that uses image conversion from network data flow to produce an RGB image that can be classified using advanced deep learning models. In this method, we proposed to use the decision tree algorithm to identify the important features, and a windowing and overlapping mechanism to convert the varying input size to a standard size image for the classifier.

Network security time series is a reliable source to obtain future network security situation, so as to develop network security defense strategy by exploring the correlation of time series. The network security time series is a reliable source to obtain the future network security situation, and it is the main direction of current network security defense by exploring the correlation of time series, and analyzing the future network security situation so as to formulate network security defense strategies. This is the main direction of network security defense. The existing research focuses on the short-term prediction of network attacks, and the robustness and accuracy of long-term prediction still have big problems. To fuse the information from different data sources and capture the correlation between sequences, we design a data source selection module based on the similarity of measurement curves. We then model the network security situation prediction based on deep learning models and propose a situation prediction model based on Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-combined Transformer, which focuses on the time series long-term prediction problem, combining the network condition and attack situation to obtain the future network security situation. Our proposed model is divided into three parts, which are the information encoding module, the information synthesis module, and situation value calculation and prediction accuracy evaluation module. The selected multi-dimensional situations element data are used as model input, and the TCN-combined Transformer is employed as the network security situational data processing unit to complete the information fusion and prediction tasks. Finally, the role of data source selection on prediction accuracy is evaluated using an ablation study. We experimented and evaluated the model at different prediction horizon lengths using five existing baseline models and three performance metrics. The experimental results show that our proposed prediction model has better robustness and accuracy in most of the metrics.},

    abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an in-depth proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems linked to Industry 4.0 technology. The increasing rate of IoT device usage is associated with rising security risks resulting from malicious network flows during data exchange between the connected devices. Various security threats have shown high adverse effects on the availability, functionality, and usability of the devices among which denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS), which attempt to exhaust the capacity of the IoT network (gateway), thereby causing failure in the functionality of the system have been more pronounced. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used to propose intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate the challenging effects of these network threats. One concern is that although deep learning algorithms have shown good accuracy results on tabular data, not all deep learning algorithms can perform well on tabular datasets, which happen to be the most commonly available format of datasets for machine learning tasks. Again, there is also the challenge of model explainability and feature selection, which affect model performance. In this regard, we propose a model for IDS that uses attentive mechanisms to automatically select salient features from a dataset to train the IDS model and provide explainable results, the TabNet-IDS. We implement the proposed model using the TabNet algorithm based on PyTorch which is a deep-learning framework. The results obtained show that the TabNet architecture can be used on tabular datasets for IoT security to achieve good results comparable to those of neural networks, reaching an accuracy of 97% on CIC-IDS2017, 95% on CSE-CICIDS2018 and 98% on CIC-DDoS2019 datasets.},

However, existing NID methods usually require a large amount of labeled data for training, which is impractical in many real application scenarios due to the high cost. To address this issue, we proposed an extreme semi-supervised framework based on transformer (ESet) for NID. ESeT first developed a multi-level feature extraction module to learn both packet-level byte encoded features and flow-level frequency domain features to enrich the information for detection. Then, during the semi-supervised learning, ESeT designed the dual-encoding transformer to fuse the extracted features for intrusion detection and introduced the credibility selector to reduce the negative impacts of incorrect pseudo-labeling of unlabeled data. The experiment results show that our model achieves excellent performance (F1-score: 97.60%) with only a small proportion of labeled data (1%) on CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets.},

    abstract = {Traditional machine learning makes a basic assumption: the training and test data should be under the same distribution. However, in many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund & Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.},

    abstract = {Domain adaptation allows knowledge from a source domain to be transferred to a different but related target domain. Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

    abstract = {Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) play an essential role in the defense of computer networks by identifying a computer networks' unauthorized access and investigating potential security breaches. Traditional NIDSs encounters difficulties to combat newly created sophisticated and unpredictable security attacks. Hence, there is an increasing need for automatic intrusion detection solution that can detect malicious activities more accurately and prevent high false alarm rates (FPR). In this paper, we propose a novel network intrusion detection framework using a deep neural network based on the pretrained VGG-16 architecture. The framework, TL-NID (Transfer Learning for Network Intrusion Detection), is a two-step process where features are extracted in the first step, using VGG-16 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and in the 2ndstep a deep neural network is applied to the extracted features for classification. We applied TL-NID on NSL-KDD, a benchmark dataset for network intrusion, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively learn from the NSL-KDD dataset with producing a realistic performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and false alarm. This study also aims to motivate security researchers to exploit different state-of-the-art pre-trained models for network intrusion detection problems through valuable knowledge transfer.},

    abstract = {Data centralization can potentially increase Internet of Things (IoT) usage. The trend is to move IoT devices to a centralized server with higher memory capacity and a more robust management interface. Hence, a larger volume of data will be transmitted, resulting in more network security issues. Cloud IoT offers more advantages for deploying and managing IoT systems through minimizing response delays, optimal latency, and effective network load distribution. As a result, sophisticated network attack strategies are deployed to leverage the vulnerabilities in the extensive network space and exploit user information. Several attempts have been made to provide network intrusion detection systems (IDS) to the cloud IoT interface using machine learning and deep learning approaches on dedicated IDS datasets. This paper proposes a transfer learning IDS based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that has shown excellent results on image classification. We use five pre-trained CNN models, including VGG16, VGG19, Inception, MobileNet, and EfficientNets, to train on two selected datasets: CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CICIDS2018. Before the training, we carry out preprocessing, imbalance treatment, dimensionality reduction, and conversion of the feature vector into images suitable for the CNN architecture using Quantile Transformer. Three best-performing models (InceptionV3, MobileNetV3Small, and EfficientNetV2B0) are selected to develop an ensemble model called efficient-lightweight ensemble transfer learning (ELETL-IDS) using the model averaging approach. On evaluation, the findings show that the ELETL-IDS outperformed existing state-of-the-art proposals in all evaluation metrics, reaching 100% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. We use Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to validate this result and compared it to the AUC-ROC, which maintained an exact value of 0.9996. To this end, our proposed model is lightweight, efficient, and reliable enough to be deployed in cloud IoT systems for intrusion detection.},

    abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), network security has become very important as cyber-attackers can easily compromise such distributed networks and systems. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a basic and essential security mechanism to detect malicious traffic. In the literature, in addition to traditional machine learning algorithms, many deep learning schemes have been examined to enhance the detection performance. However, insufficient amounts of labeled samples are still a challenge for real-world implementation, especially in some scenarios such as smart home and Internet of Vehicles. To address this issue, we explore transfer learning as a promising solution. In this work, we develop TDL-IDS, a transfer deep learning based IDS that can work with limited labeled data items. Our approach first uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train a model on the source domain and then leverages transfer learning to continue the training process on the target domain. In the evaluation, we use NSL-KDD as the source domain, and AWID as the target domain. Our results indicate that TDL-IDS can outperform many similar approaches.},

    abstract = {Convolution Neural Network (ConvNet) offers a high potential to generalize input data. It has been widely used in many application areas, such as visual imagery, where comprehensive learning datasets are available and a ConvNet model can be well trained and perform the required function effectively. ConvNet can also be applied to network intrusion detection. However, the currently available datasets related to the network intrusion are often inadequate, which makes the ConvNet learning deficient, hence the trained model is not competent in detecting unknown intrusions. In this paper, we propose a ConvNet model using transfer learning for the network intrusion detection. The model consists of two concatenated ConvNets and is built on a two-stage learning process: learning a base dataset and transferring the learned knowledge to the learning of the target dataset. Our experiments on the NSLKDD dataset show that the proposed model can improve the detection accuracy not only on the test dataset containing mostly known attacks (KDDTest $+)$ but also on the test dataset featuring many novel attacks (KDDTest-21) – about 2.68% improvement on KDDTest+ and 22.02% on KDDTest-21 can be achieved, as compared to the traditional ConvNet model.},

However, keeping the DL based detection models up to date requires large amounts of new labeled training data which is often expensive and time-consuming to collect. In this paper, we investigate the viability of transfer learning (TL), an approach that enables transferring learned features and knowledge from a trained source model to a target model with minimal new training data. We compare the performance of a NIDS model trained using TL with a NIDS model trained from scratch. We show that TL enables detection models to perform much better at identifying new attacks when there is relatively less training data available.},

    abstract = {New and unseen network attacks pose a great threat to the signature-based detection systems. Consequently, machine learning-based approaches are designed to detect attacks, which rely on features extracted from network data. The problem is caused by different distribution of features in the training and testing datasets, which affects the performance of the learned models. Moreover, generating labeled datasets is very time-consuming and expensive, which undercuts the effectiveness of supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we propose using transfer learning to detect previously unseen attacks. The main idea is to learn the optimized representation to be invariant to the changes of attack behaviors from labeled training sets and non-labeled testing sets, which contain different types of attacks and feed the representation to a supervised classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use a feature-based transfer learning technique to detect unseen variants of network attacks. Furthermore, this technique can be used with any common base classifier. We evaluated the technique on publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning to detect new network attacks.},

  abstract = 	 {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.}
